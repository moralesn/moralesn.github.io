Hi, I'm Norberto Morales and I enjoy uncovering meaningful insights using data. I want to use this site to help 
people learn new skills and share what they learn with others. 

I received a masters in Political Science from Texas A&M University while leading research on subjects as diverse as global banking and the economic costs of conflict. I have written about 
my research [here]() and various resources for teaching statistics [here](http://www.norbertormorales.com/stata-workshops/). Prior to my graduate work, I was an Economics undergraduate at Florida State
University researching the factors that shape the value of currencies throughout the globe. When I'm not discovering things with data, you can
find me hiking in trails, kayaking, and learning about technology.
