Statistical analysis can involve relatively large start-up costs on the way to learning best practices and more advanced techniques. [Stata](http://www.stata.com/) can be useful to this end, facilitating statistical analysis in a user friendly interface and without the need for extensive programming experience. 

The [following](https://github.com/moralesn/stata_workshopsblob/master/README.md) sessions stemmed from my experience teaching statistical analysis and modeling at the graduate level. They demonstrate some best data management, visualization, and statistical modeling practices in the context of Stata syntax. To learn more, refer to names of workshops I have taught in the recent past:

##Example Workshops 

* Normal Distributions
* Sample Selection
* Heteroskedasticity and Multicollinearity 
* Outliers
* Linear Regression
* Interactions
* Logit and Probit
* Loops

These sessions can allow users to maximize their impact in their respective fields. While Stata can be a useful tool—specifically for less computationally demanding projects— skills in tools such as R, SQL, and SAS are highly prized for more advanced tasks.

##Download

To download the relevant .do files for each lab session you can visit the [project page](https://github.com/moralesn/stata_workshops). You will need an up-to-date copy of Stata 12 or Stata 13 to run the code files.
