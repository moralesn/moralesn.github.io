Statistical analysis can involve some start-up costs on the way to learning best practices and more advanced techniques. [Stata](http://www.stata.com/) is a statistical can be useful to this end, facilitating statistical analysis in a user friendly interface and without the need for extensive programming experience.

The [following](https://github.com/moralesn/stata_workshopsblob/master/README.md) sessions stemmed from my experience teaching statistical analysis and modeling at the graduate level. They demonstrate some best data management, data manipulation, visualization, and statistical modeling practices in the context of Stata syntax. To learn more, refer to names of workshops I have taught and included under the download section:

##Example Workshops 

*Normal Distributions

*Sample Selection

*Heteroskedasticity and Multicollinearity 

*Outliers

*Linear Regression

*Interactions

*Logit and Probit

*Loops

Beyond being a useful tool—especially when comfronting less computationally demanding tasks—Stata can allow users to maximize their impact through these sessions. 

##Download

You will need to download and run the relevant .do files for each session of the workshop. Find out more
