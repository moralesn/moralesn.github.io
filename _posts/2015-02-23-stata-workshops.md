title: Stata Workshops
---

[Stata](http://www.stata.com/) is a statistical software widely used in academia and for relatively smaller scale projects throughout the coorporate community. The [following](https://github.com/moralesn/stata_workshopsblob/master/README.md) series of code files stemmed from my experience teaching statistical analysis and modeling at the graduate level. They cover best data management, data manipulation, visualization, and statistical modeling practices in Stata syntax. 
The following are some of the brief examples of workshops I have taught included under the download section:

##Example Workshops 

*Normal Distributions

*Sample Selection

*Heteroskedasticity and Multicollinearity 

*Outliers

*Linear Regression

*Interactions

*Logit and Probit

*Loops

Beyond being a very useful tool—especially when comfronting less computationally demanding tasks—Stata can help users to maximize
their impact through these sessions. 

##Download

You will need to download and run the relevant .do files for each session of the workshop. Find out more
by visiting the project page on [GitHub](https://github.com/moralesn/stata_workshops).
